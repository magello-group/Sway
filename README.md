# Sway
An application made for matching CVs with Assignments at Magello using AI. 

Initial version will include a desktop Wpf application written in C#, and on the backend calls will be made against the Opper AI API. 

**UPDATE:**
This project has been discontinued here on GitHub and is now living as a repo in the Azure private realm at Magello. Thus, this repo can be deleted, and hasn't been so this far to be sure we haven't missed anything in the transfer. When the assurance is there, we can proceed with the deletion of this repo.
